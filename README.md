# BBExplore
A Breaking Bad Demo App

The VIPER-like architecture of this app attempts to keep responsibilities of its components separate. 

Logic concerned with Breaking Bad characters should only be in CharactersModule while logic concerning 
the display of a list of cells in a tableview should be in ListUIModile. 

App-specific code is prefixed with "BB"
